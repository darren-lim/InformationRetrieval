If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat 
longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and 
running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets 
longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to ']
use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition 
into each program.
